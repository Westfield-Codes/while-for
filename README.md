# JS-Loop-Katas
Exercises for mastery of JS loop syntax

1. **script.js** is where you paste comments, then build and test code.
2. **index.html** is the web page that chooses the script file to run. **Don't edit it.**
3. **guess-kata.js and multiply-kata.js** are instructions for writing code. **Don't edit them.**
4. **done.js** is where you can paste code you've built for reference.

Don't leave code you write in script.js.  After you have finished working with a kata, move that code to done.js - or delete it.
